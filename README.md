# ANN + Economics + Flux

This repository contains a collection of notebooks illustrating the use of
[Artificial Neural Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) to solve economic models. The code is in [Julia](https://www.google.com/search?channel=fs&client=ubuntu&q=julia)
and uses the package [Flux.jl](https://fluxml.ai/Flux.jl/stable/) for the machine-learning part.

## ANN_1.ipynb

ANN example with Flux.jl with two simple functions.

See: https://julienpascal.github.io/post/ann_1/


## ANN_2.ipynb

ANN to solve for a simple Bellman equation. The function to approximate is unknown.
